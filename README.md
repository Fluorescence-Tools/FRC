##Seidel software for FRET-nanoscopy analysis
###functionality
*Core functionality*
1) reading photon streams from picoquant .ptu files and transforming them into xy-lifetime images
2) Bayesian framework to optimally determine the number and location of emitters in an image snapshot
3) Forming individual emitters into FRET pairs and calculating FRET parameters
*Additional functionality*
4) Bayesian framework for fitting 1D histograms with non-centered Chi and Gaussian distributions.
5) Molecular assembly particle averaging based on coarse alignment and Prokrustes analysis

### Developer's notice
To make this tools usable for non-programmers, functionalities 4) and 5) will receive a dedicated GUI. Other sections will be re-written to make use of libraries that were unavailable at the time of initial writing.
